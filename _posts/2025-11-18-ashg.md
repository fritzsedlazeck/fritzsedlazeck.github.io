The Fritz Sedlazeck group had a great time at AHSG 2025 in Boston, where we brought home one oral talk and four posters—a solid showing for the team. The meeting was buzzing with energy, fueled by exciting conversations and the latest tech from PacBio, ONT, Illumina, and others. Between catching up with collaborators, meeting new friends in the field, and exploring fresh ideas, AHSG 2025 turned out to be both scientifically inspiring and genuinely fun. We’re already looking forward to next year!
