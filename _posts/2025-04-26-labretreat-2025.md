This year, the Sedlazeck, Treangen, and Villapol labs came together for a retreat full of science, collaboration, and a lot of great ideas.

From mosaicism analysis, microbiome profiling, and cancer genomics, to new tools for primer design, inversion calling, and synthetic DNA screening — our talks covered a wide range of exciting topics. We even managed a few travel adventures along the way, racing from DC to Boston to Houston in record time!

Thank you to everyone who shared their work and energy. We’re proud of the amazing science happening across our teams — and we're just getting started!
