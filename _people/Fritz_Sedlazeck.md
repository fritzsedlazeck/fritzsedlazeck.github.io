# Research 

I am a computational Biologist focusing on method developing for sequencing applications.   
In general, my interests focus on three key areas:  

1. Sequence Analysis: 
  * Method development to analyze Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data
  * Detection of Structural Variations
  * Assessment of the variability of genomes 
2. High performance computing: 
  * Programming on GPU Graphics Cards (CUDA, OpenCL)
  * Programming on CPUs (SSE, AVX)
  * Programming on Grid Engine (SGE, Slurm)
